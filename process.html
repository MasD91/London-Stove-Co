            <p> <b>Request a quote</b>
            <br>
            Once we have more information about your project, we can get over an estimated cost for the works, if this meets your expectations we can then arrange a site survey to discuss your options further. You can start by requesting a quote <a href="signup.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <div class="box">
            <p> <b>Site Survey</b>
            <br>
            Site surveys are more comprehensive than estimates. Our visit involve on-site inspections, measurements, chimney stack access assessment and include discussions to understand specific needs and look you’re wanting to achieve.
        </p>

        <div class="box">
            <p> <b>Quote/Proforma</b>
                <br>
                After our site survey we will be able to provide you with a full broken down quotation including the stove you have chosen. We require a 50% deposit in order to book in a date. Once the deposit has been received your date is confirmed.

            <p> <b>Stove Installation Day</b>
                <br>
                Our installations are all carried out by our in house team with many years experience, you will usually see a familiar face as it will be the same company representative who surveyed your project. We do ask that any small soft furnishing be removed before the day of our visit. While most stove installations are completed within 1-2 days, allowing for a buffer is recommended in-case of any unforeseen challenges or modifications to the existing structures.

        <div class="box last-box">
            <p> <b>Commissioning & Hetas Certification</b>
                <br>
                Upon completion of your installation our team will commission & run you through how to operate your new stove, along with answering any questions you may have. Once you’re happy with the hand over we will light your stove for the first time. You will then receive an email containing tips and tricks to keep your stove in good condition. Once the remaining balance has been settled you will receive a certificate from HETAS within a month through the post.            </p>

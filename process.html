            <p> <b>Request a quote</b>
            <br>
            Once we have more information about your project, we can get over an estimated cost for the works, if this meets your expectations we can then arrange a site survey to discuss your options further

            <p> <b>Site Survey</b>
            <br>
            Site surveys are more comprehensive than estimates. Our visit involve on-site inspections, measurements, chimney stack access assessment and include discussions to understand specific needs and look you’re wanting to achieve.

            <p> <b>Quote/Proforma</b>
                <br>
                After our site survey we will be able to provide you with a full broken down quotation including the stove you have chosen. We require a 50% deposit in order to book in a date. Once the deposit has been received your date is confirmed.

            <p> <b>Stove Installation Day</b>
                <br>
                Our installations are all carried out by our in house team with many years experience, you will usually see a familiar face as it will be the same company representative who surveyed your project. We do ask that any small soft furnishing be removed before the day of our visit. While most stove installations are completed within 1-2 days, allowing for a buffer is recommended in-case of any unforeseen challenges or modifications to the existing structures

        <div class="box">
            <p> <b>Commissioning & Hetas Certification</b>
                <br>
                Upon completion of your installation our team will commission & run you through how to operate your new stove, along with answering any questions you may have. Once you’re happy with the hand over we will light your stove for the first time. You will then receive an email containing tips and tricks to keep your stove in good condition. Once the remaining balance has been settled you will receive a certificate from HETAS within a month through the post.            </p>

            <p> <b>Chimney lining</b>
                <br>
                Chimney lining refers to the installation of a protective layer inside a chimney to enhance safety and efficiency. The primary purpose of chimney lining is to contain and direct the byproducts of combustion (such as smoke, gases, and creosote) safely out of the home and into the atmosphere. There are various types of chimney liners, and the choice often depends on the type of fuel being burned (wood, gas, oil, etc.) and the specific requirements of the chimney.
<br>
The benefits of chimney lining include:
<br>
· Improved Safety: Liners help contain and direct combustion byproducts, reducing the risk of chimney fires and carbon monoxide exposure.
<br>
· Increased Efficiency: A properly lined chimney promotes better draft and allows for more efficient venting of gases.
<br>
· Protection of Masonry: Liners protect the chimney structure from the corrosive effects of combustion byproducts.s
